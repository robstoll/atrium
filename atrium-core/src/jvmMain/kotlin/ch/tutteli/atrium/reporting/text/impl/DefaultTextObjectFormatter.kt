     * Returns a formatted version of the given [value].

     * - `null` is represented as [Text.NULL].[Text.string]
     * - [LazyRepresentation] is [evaluated][LazyRepresentation.eval] and then again [format]ted
     * - [Char] is put in apostrophes
     * - [Boolean] is represented with its [toString] representation
     * - [String] is put in quotes and its [Class.getName] is omitted
     * - [CharSequence] is put in quotes, but [KClass.qualifiedName] is used in contrast to [String]
     * - [Text] is represented as [Text.string]
     * - [ch.tutteli.atrium.reporting.translating.Translatable] is represented as result of its translation
     * - [Class] is represented as "[Class.getSimpleName] ([Class.getName])"
     * - [KClass] is represented as "[KClass.simpleName] ([KClass.qualifiedName])" unless the [KClass.qualifiedName]
     *   differs from [Class.getName] in which case, "-- Class: [Class.getName]" is appended in addition
     * - [Enum] is represented as "[toString] ([Class.getName])
     * - [Throwable] is represented as "[Class.getName]"
     * - All other objects are represented as "[toString] ([Class.getName] <[System.identityHashCode]>)"
     *
     * @param value The value which shall be formatted.
     *
     * @return The formatted [value].
