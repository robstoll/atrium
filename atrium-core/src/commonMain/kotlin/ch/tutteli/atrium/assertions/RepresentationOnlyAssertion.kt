/**
 * The base interface for [Assertion]s which only consist of a [representation] (next to [holds]).
 *
 * This assertion is typically used within an [AssertionGroup] where the description of the group gives enough context
 * so that it is enough if the assertion consists only of a representation of an instance.
 *
 * For instance, representing `notToEqualOneOf(1, 2, 3)` can be achieved with an expectation-group and inner
 * [RepresentationOnlyAssertion]s.
