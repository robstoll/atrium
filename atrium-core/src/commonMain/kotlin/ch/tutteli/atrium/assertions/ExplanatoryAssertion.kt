 * Represents an [Assertion] which can be used to explain/show an instance which is eventually formatted
 * by an [ObjectFormatter] in reporting -- it needs to be a child of an [AssertionGroup]
 * with an [ExplanatoryAssertionGroupType].
 *
 * As it is a child of an [AssertionGroup] with an [ExplanatoryAssertionGroupType], it is not of importance
 * whether the assertions holds or not; thus it overrides [holds] which always returns `true`.
 *
 * This assertion will be turned into a `Reportable` with 1.0.0 and eventually/latest be removed with 1.0.0
 * See https://github.com/robstoll/atrium-roadmap/issues/1 for more information.
