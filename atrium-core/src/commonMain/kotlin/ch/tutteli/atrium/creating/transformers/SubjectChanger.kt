     * in the sense of "I expect the transformation xy to succeed", i.e. it should be included in reporting as well.
     * For instance, say you want to change the subject of type `Int?` to `Int`.

     *   A failure handler has the chance to augment the failing proof representing the failed transformation
     *   with further information (and hints).
     * @param maybeSubExpectationCreatorAndUsageHints Optionally, a pair where the first element represents subsequent
     *   expectations for the new subject. This is especially useful if the change fails since we can then
     *   already show to you (in error reporting) what you expect about the new subject (which gives you more

     *   (or there is simply no alternative) in which case only the failing expectation is shown.
