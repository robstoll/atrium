 * In detail, It compares the absolute difference between the subject and [expected];
 * as long as it is less than or equal the [tolerance] the assertion holds; otherwise it fails.
 * A more mathematical way of expressing the assertion is the following inequality:
 *

 *
 * @return an [Expect] for the subject of `this` expectation.
